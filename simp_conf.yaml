---
# === use_fips ===
# Enable FIPS mode on this system.
#
# FIPS mode enforces strict compliance with FIPS-140-2.  All core SIMP modules
# can support this configuration.
#
# IMPORTANT: Be sure you know the security tradeoffs of FIPS-140-2 compliance.
# FIPS mode disables the use of MD5 and may require weaker ciphers or key lengths
# than your security policies allow.

# === dns::servers ===
# A list of DNS servers for the managed hosts.
#
# If the first entry of this list is set to '127.0.0.1', then
# all clients will configure themselves as caching DNS servers
# pointing to the other entries in the list.
#
# If you have a system that's including the 'named' class and
# is *not* in this list, then you'll need to set a variable at
# the top of that node entry called $named_server to 'true'.
# This will get around the convenience logic that was put in
# place to handle the caching entries and will not attempt to
# convert your system to a caching DNS server. You'll know
# that you have this situation if you end up with a duplicate
# definition for File['/etc/named.conf'].
